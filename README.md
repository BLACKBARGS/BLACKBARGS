Software Engineer
-----------------

👋 Hey there! I'm a Software Engineer in training — but already knee-deep in real development. Since I started my journey, I've been building projects that focus on clean architecture, logic-driven structure, and secure, scalable systems that solve real problems. 💻 One of my main projects is EmployeeSystem, a full-featured employee management system. I’ve implemented secure JWT authentication with refresh tokens, role-based access control (admin/user), and built a clean user registration and update flow. The system is designed with Blazor and .NET at its core, and I'm always working on making it more modular and maintainable. 🔐 I'm particularly careful with access logic — for example, making sure users can't escalate their privileges or manipulate roles without proper permissions. I use HTTP context to enforce strict security rules, and I’ve designed the repository pattern to clearly distinguish between admin and normal users. 🧠 My code style emphasizes simplicity and organization. I believe naming, structure, and clear logic are what make a system reliable in the long term. When I refactor code, I avoid unnecessary renaming just to “clean up” — I prefer meaningful improvements that don’t break what’s already working. 🛠️ My stack includes C#, .NET, Blazor, Entity Framework, SQL (MySQL, SQLite, Oracle), and Git. I'm also experienced with containerization (Docker), cloud tools (Azure), and recently started diving into machine learning to explore how AI can help communities — like analyzing weather data to predict future flood risks. 📚 I'm constantly learning, with courses like Harvard’s CS50x and CS50AI under my belt, and certifications in cybersecurity and AI engineering. I’m the type who doesn’t just want to watch change happen — I want to be part of it. Let’s build something meaningful.
